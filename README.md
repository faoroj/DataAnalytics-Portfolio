# [Project 1: Audible Insights: Audiobook Trends and Visualizations Over Time](https://github.com/faoroj/Audible-Data-Project)

I used this personal project to practice cleaning a very messy set of data on 87000 audible trends over time, along with this I performed some exploratory analysis to review some trends within the data once cleaned.


# [Project 2: "Michigan Water Use Patterns: 2013-2022"](https://github.com/faoroj/Michigan-Water-Usage)

I undertook this personal project to perform some basic cleaning and exploratory analysis to further support my visualizations I later created in Tableau. These visualizations provided valuable insights into Michigan's water use patterns from 2013 to 2022, enabling a deeper understanding of how different industries utilize water resources across the state.
