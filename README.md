# [Project 1: "World Causes Of Death 1990-2019"](https://github.com/faoroj/Cause-of-Death-Analysis/tree/main)


# [Project 2: "Audible Data Cleaning and Exploring Trends Over Time"](https://github.com/faoroj/Audible-Data-Project)

 I used this personal project to practice cleaning a very messy set of data on 87,000 audible trends over time, along with this I performed some exploratory analysis to review some trends within the data once cleaned.


# [Project 3: "Michigan Water Use Patterns: 2013-2022"](https://github.com/faoroj/Michigan-Water-Usage)

I undertook this personal project to perform basic cleaning and exploratory analysis to support the visualizations I later created in Tableau. These visualizations provided valuable insights into Michigan's water use patterns from 2013 to 2022, enabling a deeper understanding of how different industries utilize water resources across the state.


# [Project 4: "Video Game Sales Dashboard"](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jordon.faoro/viz/VideoGameVisualizationDB/VideoGamesVizDB#1)

I created a comprehensive Tableau dashboard to visualize and analyze global video game sales data. The dataset includes information on game names, platforms, release years, genres, publishers, regional sales (NA, EU, JP, and other regions), and global sales figures. The project aims to uncover key insights and trends in the video game industry, providing valuable information for stakeholders, analysts, and enthusiasts. 

# [Project 5: "CS Students Database Analysis"](https://github.com/faoroj/CS_Student_Data_Project)

I conducted an in-depth analysis of CS student demographics, education levels, and technology usage patterns. I utilized SQL to clean and aggregate data, uncovering trends in developer preferences, social media usage, and programming languages. This analysis provides insights into student backgrounds, technology engagement, and future career aspirations, aiding in understanding current and future developer landscapes.
